        are currently looking for contractors or part-time/project-based
        workers. Given that the gig culture is undoubtedly on a hike –
        Freelancing has become more popular than ever.

          What is a Freelance visa, and how can you start freelancing legally in
          the UAE?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        A freelance visa is a residence visa that allows you to live in the
        country. You will also need a work permit or freelance license to start
        legally freelancing in the UAE, along with a freelance visa.
      </p>
      <p>
        A freelance work permit allows freelancers to take up part-time and
        project-based jobs around the country with as little as no hassle. In
        comparison, a freelance license is equivalent to registering an
        independent one-person company.

        If you are a tourist holding a visit visa in Dubai – be on the lookout
        for the overstaying fines. Keep a check on your visa expiry date before
        it’s too late.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Dubai, tourists with a visit visa have a grace period of 10 days over
        the visa expiry date. If you overstay beyond the grace period without a
        change in your visa status – you are eligible to be fined per day
        thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
        First day of overstaying i.e., the first day after the grace period, you
        will be fined AED200 Then, AED 100 for a service fee. After which, you
        have to pay AED 100 each consecutive day you overstay.
      </p>
      <p>Where can you pay the fine?</p>
      <p>
        You can settle your overstaying fines at any airport, seaport, land
        border, immigration offices, Amer office & typing centres.

        If you wish to settle your overstay fines before leaving the country to
        reduce the time consumption on your exit day – you can visit any of the
        local immigration offices, Amer Offices or typing centres.

        considering going solo and moving to a freelance career as an option?
        Well, either way – here’s what you must keep in mind as you choose to
        freelance in Dubai.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be able to pick your own projects, set your own schedule and be your
        own boss, you’ll need the two most important things:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. A Residence Visa 2. <br />A Freelance Permit/License.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Freelance permit/License allows you to legally work as a Freelancer, a
        sole practitioner or an independent contractor in the Emirates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step you must take before you begin your freelance journey is
        to choose where you would like to freelance – UAE Mainland or Free
        zones.
      </p>
      <p>The difference between freelancing on the Mainland and Free zone?</p>

        freedom and a broad scope of opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>Freelance on Free zone:</p>
      <p>
        As a free zone freelancer, you can conduct your freelance activities
        only within your registered free zone/jurisdiction. Each free zone has a
        different set of freelance activities that you can choose from.
      </p>
      <p>
